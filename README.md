# **EI_Bouygues: IoT Sensor Anomaly Detection**

This project was conducted as part of an **Enseignement-Intégration (EI)** at **CentraleSupélec** in collaboration with **Bouygues**. The aim was to analyze data from IoT sensors to **detect anomalies**, determine their cause (system error, user misuse, or cyber-attacks), and visualize the results in an interpretable way.

## **Project Description**

IoT sensors generate continuous data streams, which can include **anomalies** due to various issues. In this project, we focused on:
1. **Detecting anomalies** in sensor data.  
2. Understanding the **cause** of these anomalies:  
   - System error,  
   - User error, or  
   - External attack.  
3. **Visualizing the results** to make them clear and actionable.

We explored both **traditional methods** and advanced techniques like **autoencoders** (including convolutional autoencoders) for anomaly detection.

## **Technologies Used**

The project was implemented in **Python** with the following libraries:  
- **Data Analysis**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `random`  
- **Data Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`  
- **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn`  
- **Deep Learning**: `PyTorch`, `torchvision`
